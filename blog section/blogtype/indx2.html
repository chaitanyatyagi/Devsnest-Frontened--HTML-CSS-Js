        <p><h2>Glamping In The Western Ghats: When Serenity Beckons</h2><br>
            <br>
            <h1>Why Glamping Is The Need Of The Hour?</h1><br>
            It's a clear day; misty clouds have made their home on top of verdant hills in the distance. The nearby roaring waterfall plays nature's metal tunes, with an odd bullfrog chiming in now and then. The pitter-patter of raindrops has given a glistening emerald coat to the landscape, and for miles, the most prominent pop of colour is the peppy red of my luxury Swiss tent. It drizzles on and off all day. The clouds drift from one hill to the other and the breeze stirring the skies occasionally comes down to ruffle my hair. As the day progresses, clouds roll down the mountainside and wrap everything in a moist blanket, the sun is there but the thick mist has cast a veil on the land. This is, but one, aspect of glamping in the Western Ghats.<br>
            <br>
            Monsoon is among the best times to go glamping in this part of India. After all, it has emerged as one of the top global travel trends for the year 2020. It blends road trips, separate lodging and spending time in picturesque outdoors- three major travel trends right now.<br>
            <br>
            Glamping combines the adventure of camping in the great outdoors with luxury and how! And the best part, there’s so much to look forward to- from simply lolling around to going all adventurous with trekking and hiking to cooking your own food. It’s a win-win situation for both the host and the guest. Nothing is as picture-postcard perfect in monsoons in India than the Western Ghats, which are home to a couple of notable glamping sites.
