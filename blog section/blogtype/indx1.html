        <p><h2>India's Unique Forts</h2><br>
            <br>
            <h1>Manjarabad Fort, Karnataka</h1><br>
            A bird's eye view of the Manjarabad Fort looks like a star, which is why it is popularly
            recognised as the Star Fort. Located in Karnataka, this grand fort was built by Tipu Sultan and
            reflects the brilliance of Islamic architecture. Constructed in an octagonal shape, with eight
            walls, the fort is unique in the sense that it has only one level, unlike other forts with
            multiple levels. Legend has it that this fort was used as a frontier to store guns and
            ammunition and provided protection to Tipu Sultanâ€™s army against the British.<br>
            <br>
            While touring the fort is an unforgettable experience, it also provides spectacular views of the
            Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea. Tourists can also explore various chambers in the fort and a
            tunnel that leads to Srirangapatna Fort.<br>
            <br>
            <h1>Murud Janjira, Maharashtra</h1><br>
            Sprawled on an island off the coastal village of Murud, about 55 km from Alibaug, Murud Janjira
            Fort is perched on a massive rock that lies in the middle of the Arabian Sea.<br>
            <br>
            The architecture of the fort has fared well in the test of time, with 19 of its bastions
            standing tall to this day. Tourists can get here via boats, and enjoy the spectacular view of
            the Arabian Sea that the roof of the fort offers.<br>
            <br>
            <h1>Bhujia Fort, Gujarat</h1><br>
            Located on the outskirts of Bhuj, Bhujia Fort is a marvel hidden away in the hills. Constructed
            as a fortification against invasions by the Mughal, Sindh and Rajput rulers, in 1700-1800 AD,
            this fort was commissioned under Rao Godji I. Today, the fort is best known for the Bhujang Nath
            Temple, where special prayers are performed during Nag Panchami.<br>
            <br>
            The fort sits on a hill which overlooks the entire area of Bhuj. It takes around 600 steps to
            reach the fort.<br>
            <br>
            <h1>Mattancherry Palace, Kerala</h1><br>
            Located in Kochi, Mattancherry Palace or Dutch Palace is one of the best examples of
            Malayalam-style architecture mixed with colonial influences. Its interiors are beautifully
            adorned, with 17th and 18th-century murals depicting scenes from the epics Ramayana and
            Mahabharata. Besides, tourists can admire life-size portraits of all the kings of Cochin since
            1864, sheathed swords, daggers and axes, together with ceremonial spears decorated with
            feathers, royal caps, coins issued by the kings of Cochin, silver sequinned gowns, royal
            umbrellas made of silk and brass, along with plans laid out for Cochin by the Dutch.<br>
            <br>
            Of note are the paintings in the king's bedchamber that depict the stories of Ramayana, the
            murals in the coronation hall that depict Goddess Lakshmi on the lotus, sleeping Lord Vishnu,
            Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati with Ardhanariswara, the coronation of Lord Rama, Lord Krishna
            lifting the mountain Govardhan and other goddesses. The room opposite Coronation Hall has
            paintings of Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu and Goddess Devi and an incomplete painting; and another
            room has murals of Kumarasambhava and works by renowned poet, Kalidasa.<br>
            <br>
            The palace was built by the Portuguese as a gift to King Veera Kerala Varma (1809-1828). It came
            to be known as the Dutch Palace because of the number of additions the Dutch made to it. The
            palace is home to the presiding deity of the royal family, the 'PazhayannurBhagavathi' (the
            Goddess of Pazhayannur).<br>
            <br>
            <b>Daulatabad Fort, Maharashtra</b><br>
            Towering over the landscape on a 200-m-high conical hill and spread over 95 hectare, the
            Daulatabad Fort is the epitome of Deccan perseverance and strategic ingenuity. In its heydays,
            the fort was considered impenetrable, owing to a complicated series of defences around and
            inside it. Mahakot, or the four distinct walls with 54 bastions surround the fort for a length
            of nearly 5 km. The walls are about 6 to 9 ft thick and 18 to 27 ft high. Ammunition depots and
            granaries housed inside in the premises add to the thrill of exploring this historical
            stronghold.<br>
            <br>
            Another interesting feature is Hathi Haud, a gigantic water tank with a capacity of about 10,000
            cubic m. Today, the huge crater leaves one in awe of its size. You can also visit the Chand
            Minar, which stands at a height of 30 ft. The Tughlaq era royal bath, an elite structure, is a
            must-visit. It has massage chambers, provisions for hot baths and steam baths for which water
            was supplied through well-laid tanks, channels, pipes, ventilators etc.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Travellers should notice the remains of the moat, the fortified walls, the step wells, the court
            building, a unique temple dedicated to Bharat Mata, a hall of public audience, water cisterns
            and a rock-cut passage. A lower city complex consisting of main routes and by-lanes was also
            revealed through recent excavation.<br>
            <br>
            Situated on the Aurangabad to Ellora road, the fort was built by king Bhillama V, a Yadava
            ruler, in 1187. The city was then known as Deogiri, or the abode of Gods. The grandiose fort was
            desired by a number of influential rulers throughout history because of its strategic
            importance. Muhammad Tughlaq, the ruler of Delhi, was so impressed by the fortress that he
            decided to move his court and capital there, renaming it Daulatabad, the city of wealth.<br>
            <br>
            The whole population of Delhi was shifted here en masse. Later, it passed on from the Bahmani
            rulers under Hasan Gangu to the Nizam Shahis of Ahmednagar. Even after this, Mughal emperor
            Aurangzeb laid a siege of four months before finally being able to capture it. It was then
            snatched away by the Marathas before being taken over by the Nizams of Hyderabad in 1724
            CE.&nbsp;
